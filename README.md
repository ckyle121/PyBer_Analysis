# PyBer Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to perfrom an exploratory analysis showing the relationship between the city and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares by riders, drivers, and type of city. The analysis and vizulations produced will help Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 
## Results 
According to data by city type, urban cities have the majority of drivers and total rides bringing in more money in total fares than both suburban and rural cities combined. However, urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and the lowest average fare per driver, which implys that urban customers of Pyber are using it for shorter commutes than suburban and rural cities. Nevertheless, the majority of customers using Pyber are in urban cities. 

The table below shows the ride-sharing data among the different city types.

The line plot below shows the total weekly of the fares for each type of city.

## Summary 
Because the majority of customers of Pyber are in urban cities, the majority of the drivers are there also. Along with urban customers taking shorter routes, the average fare per driver is approximately $16 in urban cities while suburban drivers make an average of $40 per ride and rural drivers make an average of $55 per ride. Pyber should allow drivers to take hold of this information to encourage more Pyber drivers to do their routes in suburban and rural areas. Also because the majority of urban customers take shorter commutes while rural and suburban take longer routes, Pyber should inflate the cost of shorter routes while deflating longer routes. By adding a premium for urban customers, Pyber might increase the average fare per driver for uban drivers. Finally, an incentive for customers to keep riding with Pyber is essential to keeping the business alive. If a customer recommends Pyber to a new customer, that customer should recieve a complementary ride.
