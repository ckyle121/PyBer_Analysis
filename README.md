# PyBer Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to perfrom an exploratory analysis showing the relationship between the city and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares by riders, drivers, and type of city. The analysis and vizulations produced will help Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 
## Results 
According to data by city type, urban cities have the majority of drivers and total rides bringing in more money in total fares than both suburban and rural cities combined. However, urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and the lowest average fare per driver, which implys that urban customers of Pyber are using it for shorter commutes than suburban and rural cities. Nevertheless, the majority of customers using Pyber are in urban cities. 

The table below shows the ride-sharing data among the different city types.
